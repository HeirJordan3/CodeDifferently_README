# 🌟 Hey There! I'm Jordan Eldridge 🌟

## Welcome to My Little Corner of the World

Hey! So glad you stumbled upon my README. Think of this as a backstage pass to the *Jordan Eldridge Show* - a mix of work, play, and random trivia that makes life fun. I'm all about making connections, sharing laughs, and working smart. So, let's cut the formalities and dive right in, shall we?

### 🎲 A Fun Start: 2 Truths and a Lie
First off, let's play a game to break the ice. I'll throw out three facts about myself, but catch this - one of them is a fib. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to sniff out the lie. Ready? Here we go:

1. Born in the chill vibes of Delaware.
2. My family gatherings are a mini festival with 8 siblings.
3. Got to be in the arms of the basketball legend, Kobe Bryant.

Okay, drumroll please 🥁... So, the whole Delaware thing? It's only half the story. Born in Ohio, then did my growing-up thing in Darby Township, but high school? That was all Delaware, starting 2010. And yeah, Kobe Bryant holding me is a real deal - pretty wild, right? Plus, toss in 8 siblings to the mix, and you've got my kinda crazy, totally awesome life!

### The Daily Grind: Work & Play
- **Morning Person:** I kick off my days with a workout, anytime between 5:30 and 7:30 AM. It's me time before the work frenzy begins.
- **Work Hours:** I'm on the clock from 9 AM to about 4:30-5 PM. If I missed my morning workout, I hit the gym in the evening, even though it's like a zoo.

### 🗨️ Let's Chat: Best Ways to Reach Me
- **Email:** For the deep dives and official stuff.
- **Slack:** Quick questions or just to drop a funny meme.
- **Texts:** Hit me up for anything urgent, or if you've got food. 😋

### 🚀 In Case I'm MIA
If I haven't gotten back to you, it's not you, it's me. Seriously, just text me. I'm probably just caught up in something or, let's be honest, may have spaced.

### 💭 Feedback's a Breeze
I'm all ears, always. If you've got something to share, let's grab a coffee and chat. Face-to-face is how I roll for the real talk.

### 🎯 Goals? Got 'Em!
- **Java Genius:** Working towards that Oracle Java Certification.
- **Cloud Conqueror:** Eyeing that AWS Cloud Certification next.

### 📚 What Gets Me Talking

### 🍳 Chef Jordan in the House
- **Buffalo Chicken Dip & Chili:** My go-to comfort foods that never disappoint.

### 🐾 The Home Team
- **Josie:** The furball that runs our house. She's more than a pet; she's the boss.

### 🍕 Foodie at Heart
- **Pizza and Vanilla Lattes:** My kryptonite. The simpler, the better.

### 🏡 Where I'm From
- **Darby Township, PA:** It's where my roots are, and it's made me who I am.

### 😂 Just For Laughs
This GIF is my spirit animal. Because why not?
